# Final Project: Synaesthetic Instrument
* An audiovisual instrument
* There are many interactive buttons in the program. The interaction among music, computer and human brings visual and experiential effects
* Users can not only experience music visualizations, but also create their own compositions with drum machines and keyboards 

## Contents
- Concise and simple interface, very easy to get familiar with this program and use it
- Three interesting and different style music visualizations
- A high degree of freedom drum machine that you can control the KPM, start pauses, beats, drums and so on
- Music playback progress bar (You can drag the progress bar as you like)
- Music console that you can click buttons to play or pause music, or switch music and so on
- Keyboard. Simulated piano key sounds (do, Re, Mi, FA,so...)
- There is also a special music visualization for drum machine and keyboard!

## Harmless Problem
```
It shows an error when running the program

==== JavaSound Minim Error ==== 
==== Don't know the ID3 code APIC

Through my search, ID3 tags are the textual parts of MP3 giving information like artist or title.
For some reason, Minim complains when it doesn't recognize a tag, but there are many custom tags.
These warning are harmless.
